iRO2 WPLauncher Fix
-------------------

This is a fix for Steam players who already have existing
Warp Portal accounts. It's because if you play the Steam
version of Ragnarok Online 2, you will be forced to create
and use a new account. Not a lot of people want that.

So here's the fix I came up with.

You can download the v1.0 at:

Hope this helps some!
